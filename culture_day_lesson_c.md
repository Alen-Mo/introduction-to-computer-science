#### Emphasize with students...

#### Curriculum Competencies - Applied Skills

Students may come to the course with many stereotypes/myths, about what they can do, or can't do.  Minority groups may experience greater hesitations and apprehension about technology.  By keeping a learning journal, for self-evalaution and self-reflection,  students develop confidence.   They will notice what skills they already have, what they have gained over time, what they are capable of learning, what their personal interests might be, and what they would like to learn in the future. 

It's ok not to know everything.  There is always something new to learn.  Just take one step at a time.

 #### Curricular Competencies - Sharing - Debunking stereotypes and myths
 
Celebrate you have come in your learning journey!  Don't let stereotypes, myths, or negative messages affect your motivation to learn technology, whether it's coding, creative user-centred design, or project management, and everything else in between.

The essentials skills you learn in this course will empower you to use technology in meaningful, ethical ways.
