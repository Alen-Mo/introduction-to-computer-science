# Project 2: Pong Alternative

Students will implement a well-written and engineered alternative to the Pong Project.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to ...
 
* Research, ideate, and apply personal interests to an application that includes:
    *   1 or more moving sprites
    *   2 or more user keyboard controlled sprites 
    *   The sprites should interact in a way that allows the users to accumlate a score or value. 
    
* Practice good style and conventions to create readable and maintainable code                                                                                                                                                       
## Overview

Read over Lesson 2.7 and the Pong Project (project_2.md) file. 
Your challenge is to create a project of your own that contains similar elements. 

## Details

1.  **Possible Ideas**
    1.  **Cretaceous World** <br/>
        The Elasmosaurus was a kind of water reptile that lived about 80 million years ago, in the Cretaceious period.  They has super long necks (body up to 14 meters), and their fossils have been found in British Columbia.  The speedy Albertosaurus (an early relative of the famous Tyrannosaurux rex) lived about 70 million years ago.  It was first discovered in Alberta, and fed on another dinosaur discovered in found in Canada called the Edmontosaurus. 
        
        Imagine that a few Canadian dinosaurs living on an imaginary northern frontier is being endangered by melting glaciers and sharp icebergs.  They roam around randomly.  Your goal is to move your truck (user-controlled-sprite1) to catch a dinosaur, so the it can be safely transported to another habitat where they can be safe to roam and survive.  Meanwhile a moving iceberg (user-controlled-sprite2) is endangering the animals.  When the dinosaur comes in contact with the iceberg, it is injured, and it's movement is affected. 
        
    2.  **Penny Catcher** <br/>
        
    3.  **Your Own** <br/>
        Come up with your own creative idea!

2.  **Required Checkpoints**
    1.  Create 2 or more user controlled sprites; Create 1 or more randomly moving sprite. 
    2.  When the random-sprite touches a wall it changes movement and/or direction.
    3.  Final due date: When the user-controlled sprite and random-sprite touch, something happens to the score or counter.   When the score or counter reaches are certain value, or condition, the animation is over.  

## Planning Worksheet
Part of the design process is planning.  The "Pong Planning Worksheet" is an example of how to plan.  Fill out the planning worksheet first before writing any code.

## Grading Scheme/Rubric

| Functional Correctness (Behavior)                                                    |           |
